00:04
floods they are clearly catastrophic
00:06
traumatic events although they have also
00:08
been responsible for one of the most
00:10
memorable clips in the history of
00:12
broadcast news good morning well
00:15
obviously we're getting a nice break
00:16
from the rain but not the flooding this
00:19
is essentially
00:23
that's it fuck James Cameron and fuck
00:26
Titanic because that is now officially
00:28
the greatest boat disaster ever captured
00:30
on film it's over now floods were
00:34
everywhere this summer think of them as
00:36
the des paseo of natural disasters
00:39
persistent ubiquitous and absolutely no
00:41
fault of the Puerto Rican government and
00:43
floods are always threatening 90% of all
00:46
natural disasters in the US involve a
00:48
flood which is I assume the reason that
00:50
FEMA's website once referred to flooding
00:52
as America's number one natural hazard
00:54
exclamation mark which is a pretty weird
00:57
tone to take were describing something
00:59
horrible
01:00
it's like saying boils America's number
01:02
one staph infection or parks America's
01:05
number one place to die unnoticed
01:07
and floods are only going to get worse
01:10
due to climate change and I know that
01:12
there are people who will dispute that
01:13
and we just don't have time tonight to
01:16
litigate whether extreme weather events
01:18
are exacerbated by climate change so for
01:20
now let's just say yeah they just
01:24
definitely are I mean it is a
01:29
complicated issue and we may not have
01:32
definitive proof until the late 1980s
01:34
but but while floods are often referred
01:38
to as natural disasters the truth is the
01:40
damage they do is often to some extent
01:42
within our control because we have made
01:44
certain decisions that put and keep
01:46
people and property in the path of
01:48
flooding and that is what this story is
01:50
about and before we go any further let's
01:52
acknowledge that people live near water
01:54
for all sorts of reasons for some it's
01:55
where their families of limpid
01:56
generations or a necessity for the work
01:59
that they do or for others it's a luxury
02:01
and and living next to the water is
02:02
undoubtedly attractive despite the risks
02:05
like flooding or stepping on pointy
02:07
seashells or mistakenly giving a toasty
02:10
toe to a seagull without realizing that
02:12
that means that you will now spend the
02:13
rest of your life
02:14
haunted by a tostito addicted seagull
02:16
the point is whatever the reason to live
02:19
by the water
02:20
learning to offer fuck's sake you've got
02:23
to be kidding me I don't have any
02:24
Tostitos I've been telling you that for
02:27
six years look feetoes sorry the point
02:41
is the dangers of waterfront living are
02:44
real but many people like this man who
02:46
lives on the water in Tampa Bay feel the
02:49
benefits outweigh the risks mark knows
02:51
that life here is tenuous but he doesn't
02:54
dwell on it every morning when I walk
02:55
out to get the paper I see dolphins
02:57
frolicking in the bayou and Roseate
03:00
spoonbills walking around the edge of
03:02
the Bayou so tends to make you forget
03:05
about all those sorts of things sure I
03:07
can imagine that seeing a Roseate
03:09
Spoonbill would take your mind off
03:11
things because you're spending your
03:12
whole day trying to figure out how a
03:14
flamingo could have gotten it's stupid
03:15
bird face stuck into a panini press I'm
03:18
just saying even people who like birds
03:21
don't like this bird the Audubon Society
03:24
an organization whose entire purpose is
03:26
to champion birds says they are quote
03:28
gorgeous at a distance and bizarre up
03:31
close which is like the American Kennel
03:34
Club saying we celebrate all dogs and
03:36
honor them as man's best friend but the
03:38
dandy din Mont has a trash personality
03:40
and looks like a Scottie Fox Phil
03:42
Spector look if you are literally
03:46
overlooking a bar you like that guy you
03:48
are probably aware that flooding is a
03:50
risk but not every flood prone area is
03:53
directly along the coast and sometimes
03:55
aggressive development can exacerbate
03:58
the risk of flooding even considerably
04:00
inland just look at Houston which was
04:02
recently rocked by Harvey the metro
04:04
areas development has exploded one study
04:07
found the Houston area has added 25
04:09
percent more pavement over 15 years
04:11
replacing soil rich wetlands that could
04:14
absorb water with concrete covered
04:16
suburbia exactly and that made Harvey's
04:19
damage significantly worse concrete
04:21
isn't good at absorbing water that is
04:24
why people don't dry off at the beach by
04:26
rolling around in the parking lot
04:28
but but it's not just global warming or
04:30
unchecked growth that have put more
04:32
people in risky flood prone areas it's
04:34
also the fact that it's frequently only
04:36
possible for people to take that risk
04:38
because they have flood insurance just
04:40
look at buying the beach it's a house
04:42
hunters type show for people who want to
04:44
live near the water and one episode
04:45
featured two brothers named Mitch and
04:47
Daniel arguing over a particular beach
04:49
house which led to this exchange what do
04:52
you think about the island house Mitch
04:54
well I think there is a lot of good and
04:56
a lot of bad on it right awful stepped
04:57
into the beach can't be beat we are
04:59
really close to the water that's just
05:01
another thing that's got me concerned
05:01
well that's what insurance is for that's
05:06
what insurance is for that may be the
05:09
most reckless statement ever said on a
05:11
boat and I'm very much including I can
05:13
definitely make this shot work let's
05:16
beat these goals and Tostitos and don't
05:19
have any all I did was say the word get
05:23
out of here no touch detox no touch the
05:26
dogs but Mitch Lou Tostitos but but
05:32
Mitch Mitch isn't wrong that if they
05:35
bought that house they could get flood
05:36
insurance and surprisingly cheaply and
05:38
it's worth taking some time to
05:39
understand why that is the case because
05:41
unlike other forms of homeowners
05:44
insurance flood protection is actually
05:46
underwritten by the government through
05:47
the NFIP or National Flood Insurance
05:49
Program it started nearly 50 years ago
05:52
after historic floods wiped out many
05:54
people's homes in the 1960s and the
05:56
government back then realized that there
05:57
was a real problem insurance companies
05:59
wouldn't cover floods at an affordable
06:01
cost because it was too risky so because
06:03
of that the government was spending way
06:06
too much on disaster relief so they
06:08
stepped in and created the NFIP which
06:11
offered significantly discounted
06:12
insurance to encourage people to bite
06:14
and that sounds great but crucially the
06:17
aim at the time was not that people
06:19
would be staying in at-risk homes
06:21
permanently as the program's current
06:23
administrator explains they presumed
06:26
that if we told people they were at risk
06:28
they would move they presumed that over
06:32
the life of the program those discounts
06:34
wouldn't need to be continued and they
06:37
presumed they would need to be continued
06:38
because once people knew they had the
06:40
ridge
06:40
they would move out that has not proven
06:43
true no but of course it hasn't because
06:47
that's not how people work we will
06:49
gladly accept huge risks to our personal
06:52
safety for the sake of a discount so
06:54
that was the entire premise behind the
06:56
McDonald's dollar menu and that is just
06:59
one of the many flaws with how this
07:01
well-intentioned program was designed
07:02
because everything about it from who
07:04
participates to where the money goes to
07:06
the incentives it creates needs fixing
07:09
and let's start with the fact that
07:10
eligibility for the program is
07:12
determined through flood plain Maps you
07:14
are required to buy flood insurance if
07:17
you have a federally backed mortgage and
07:19
FEMA's maps show that you live in a
07:21
risky area unfortunately the mandate has
07:24
been poorly enforced meaning that lots
07:25
of people don't buy insurance who should
07:27
and the maps themselves can be both
07:30
out-of-date and wildly inaccurate in
07:32
fact just days before Harvey struck a
07:35
study of Houston area flood maps was
07:37
published and the results were alarming
07:39
over the course of a decade researchers
07:41
at Rice University and Texas A&M;
07:43
Galveston studied one section of
07:45
Southeast Harris County they found
07:47
FEMA's flood plain Maps missed about 75%
07:50
of the damages from the storms
07:52
seventy-five percent at that point you
07:55
might as well predict floods by having
07:57
blindfolded six-year-olds pin little
07:59
cardboard puddles onto city maps at
08:01
birthday parties but even if all the
08:03
maps were perfect there would be another
08:05
floor with the NFIP which is how its
08:07
administered you see typically the
08:09
government doesn't directly insure you
08:11
instead
08:12
it pays private insurance companies a
08:14
fee for every policy they sell but not
08:16
just that the federal government is then
08:18
responsible for covering any losses
08:21
which is a pretty fucking sweet deal for
08:24
those companies they take none of the
08:26
risk and yet they get all the rewards
08:28
but it gets even worse because they also
08:29
get paid for each claim they handle and
08:32
when frontline crunched some of the
08:34
numbers and presented them to inform
08:35
ahead of the program they found
08:37
something shocking
08:38
there was one number that really jumped
08:40
out with all the claims in the wake of
08:43
Sandy the profits were more than four
08:45
hundred million dollars because they're
08:48
handling a lot of claims that year and
08:50
they get they get make a lot of money
08:51
when they hand with
08:53
when a big storm hits then they make
08:55
more money yeah at the very time you
08:57
need them to make less money if anything
08:59
because because of the burden is gonna
09:01
be borne by the taxpayers they make it
09:03
killing that's true for insurance
09:06
companies the bigger the disaster the
09:08
more they stand to profit and that is a
09:10
business model not usually seen outside
09:11
of Nicolas Cage's career and while the
09:15
insurance industry may dispute exactly
09:17
how much profit they make the fact
09:19
remains that the government and the
09:20
taxpayer are definitely the ones eating
09:23
the losses which is one of the reasons
09:25
why even before these latest hurricanes
09:27
the program was twenty five billion
09:29
dollars in debt and there are not enough
09:31
Roseate spoonbills in the world to take
09:34
your mind off that and just to be clear
09:35
there are exactly enough Roseate
09:38
spoonbills in the world I'm just saying
09:40
do we all really need more of this
09:48
any kids come see the dirty pink
09:51
dinosaur is noisily devouring its young
09:53
and look there is a good argument to
09:57
make that helping people stay in their
09:58
homes after a disaster is what
10:00
government is for but remember a big
10:03
chunk of that money is just going to the
10:05
insurance companies and another
10:06
shockingly big chunk of that money goes
10:09
to very few homes for instance along the
10:11
Gulf Coast in Florida just 1% of
10:14
properties covered by the NFIP have
10:16
accounted for a quarter of flood claims
10:19
these are called the so called
10:21
repetitive loss properties now they are
10:23
homes that can flood over and over and
10:24
over again getting payments each and
10:27
every time and and some of them are
10:28
costing us a fortune just recently an
10:31
article in The Washington Post
10:32
highlighted a home in Pointe Coupee
10:34
Parish that has flooded 40 times while
10:37
the house is valued at just 56 thousand
10:39
dollars the NFIP is doled out nearly
10:41
four hundred thirty thousand dollars to
10:44
cover flood claims so that is just
10:47
stupid because if nothing else if your
10:50
house floods 40 times
10:51
mother nature is sending you a pretty
10:53
clear message and that message is hey
10:55
would you mind leaving some weird fish
10:57
would like to fuck in here now and some
11:00
parts of the country have particularly
11:01
extreme examples of this now you
11:03
remember Mitch and Daniel the pastel
11:05
death trap that they were looking at is
11:07
on a place called dolphin Island where
11:09
over the past two decades
11:10
homeowners are paid just nine point
11:12
three million dollars in premiums into
11:14
the NFIP but they've received seventy
11:17
two point two million dollars in
11:18
payments for their damaged homes it is
11:21
so bad that the island got written up by
11:23
Bloomberg under the headline law of
11:25
coastal living is draining us disaster
11:28
funds and at first glance we thought
11:29
hold on isn't that the exact same
11:32
eyesore on stilts that Mitch and Daniel
11:34
almost bought well the good news is it's
11:36
actually not the bad news is it's
11:38
literally the house next door and it was
11:41
also featured on a different episode of
11:43
buying the beach
11:45
right in the water it wasn't close to
11:49
the beach it was in the ocean the waves
11:51
are just right here it's literally in
11:56
the ocean
11:57
this is in
11:58
yeah it is insane but what's even crazy
12:02
is at the end of the episode they
12:04
decided to buy the house but even if you
12:08
were able to overlook the repetitive
12:10
loss properties which you shouldn't
12:11
there is another issue and that is that
12:13
nearly one out of every five homes
12:15
covered under the NFIP is a second home
12:18
and because the program isn't
12:19
means-tested the benefits frequently go
12:22
to some wealthy individuals vacation
12:23
homes one such property belonged to John
12:26
Stossel a Fox News personality and
12:28
partially hydrogenated Tom Selleck and
12:30
I'll let Stossel who really answers the
12:33
question what a Freddie Mercury quit
12:34
scene to become an assistant floor
12:36
manager at Men's Wearhouse I'll let him
12:38
tell you all about it because even he
12:40
knew it was ridiculous years ago I built
12:43
this beach house that's younger me there
12:46
the house was on the edge of the
12:48
Atlantic Ocean a risky place to build
12:51
but I built anyway cuz a federal program
12:54
guaranteed my investment eventually a
12:57
storm swept away my first floor but I
12:59
didn't lose a penny thanks I never
13:02
invited you there but you paid for my
13:04
new first floor okay so now Stossel is
13:07
clearly just baiting people because
13:09
under no circumstances does anyone want
13:12
to be funding the reconstruction of the
13:14
world's smuggest man's rickety sea
13:16
prison and there is lots to be confused
13:19
about they're not not least of which
13:20
that photo of stossel posing shirtless
13:23
in skin tight white swim trunks from
13:26
hundreds of feet away who took that
13:28
photo
13:28
it can't be another human who wanted it
13:31
so here's my guess I think that he put a
13:34
camera on a long delay timer then
13:36
sprinted for a full 45 seconds back to
13:39
the deck of his house whispering hurry
13:41
hurry hurry to himself the entire time
13:43
and gone in position just in time for
13:45
that photo to happen that is the only
13:47
scientifically possible explanation we
13:50
debated this the entire fucking week and
13:53
it's the only scenario that we can all
13:54
agree on
13:56
look if you choose to build something in
14:02
a risky place like John Stossel salt
14:05
battered bottoms only beach mistake you
14:08
should absolutely be allowed to do that
14:10
but you shouldn't expect the government
14:12
to repeatedly help you rebuild when
14:14
things inevitably go wrong however the
14:17
vast majority the vast majority here of
14:19
NFIP beneficiaries are not wealthy or
14:22
second home owners they often really
14:24
need this program and cannot afford for
14:26
it to go under and for those stuck in
14:28
repetitive loss properties it is easy
14:30
for anyone to just say they should move
14:32
they should just move but it's much more
14:35
difficult than that as this Kentucky
14:37
woman whose home has flooded repeatedly
14:39
will tell you we couldn't sell her house
14:41
who would want to buy a house with us
14:44
had this me repetitive floods and it who
14:47
would want to back us we have neighbors
14:50
that have had their houses up for sale
14:51
for two or three years and haven't even
14:53
had anyone come and view the house we
14:56
need a bath from from FEMA or from
14:59
whoever it is that is responsible for
15:02
this right and her decision to try and
15:05
leave that home could not have been easy
15:07
because you don't want to throw out the
15:08
baby with the flood water but at a
15:11
certain point the responsible thing to
15:12
do is to get a better more
15:14
water-resistant baby which is
15:16
incidentally also the title of Britain's
15:18
best-selling book on teaching children
15:19
to swim now unfortunately our by our
15:22
programs are hugely underfunded and
15:25
prohibitively slow it can take years for
15:27
buyouts to get approved by which point
15:29
homeowners have probably had to rebuild
15:32
their house at the government's expense
15:33
and it may have already flooded again so
15:36
essentially a government program that
15:38
was supposed to help people in flooded
15:40
homes is sometimes trapping them inside
15:42
them indefinitely and trapping people in
15:44
structurally unsound homes isn't what
15:47
the government is for it's what buying
15:48
the beach is for
15:50
there just has to be a better way here
15:54
and there are some key things that we
15:55
can do to improve this program we can do
15:57
things like means-tested and eventually
15:59
get rid of discounts for second hunks
16:01
and gradually increase the insurance
16:03
rates on some properties so that they
16:05
reflect actual risk unfortunately the
16:07
last time the Congress tried a major
16:09
reform of the NFIP with the
16:11
biggert-waters Act of 2012 the result
16:13
was that many people's rates skyrocketed
16:16
overnight and politicians were so
16:18
spooked by angry constituents they
16:19
significantly scaled back many of the
16:22
reforms and I'm not saying that this
16:23
will ever be politically easy because
16:26
even if you do properly fund and
16:28
streamline a buyout scheme there are
16:30
still going to be cases where people
16:32
just want to stay put right here in New
16:35
York there is a low line community
16:36
called Broad Channel where the streets
16:38
can flood twice a month its residents
16:42
fought against those rate increases a
16:43
few years ago and many of them have no
16:46
interest in leaving the neighborhoods to
16:49
great then this of my whole house got
16:51
destroyed by Sandy and ivory you know I
16:54
redid my whole house I do know people
16:57
like you're crazy you should move but
17:02
you're standing in water right now maybe
17:06
the people telling you to move we're
17:07
saying at the very least can you move up
17:09
five inches to dry land but the hard
17:14
truth here is even expensive
17:16
interventions are likely to only by that
17:18
community a little more time and people
17:20
in Broad Channel will eventually be
17:22
leaving whether it's by moving truck or
17:24
by boat because environmental conditions
17:27
are going to get worse heavy downpours
17:30
have increased in the last 50 years and
17:31
sea levels have been climbing steadily
17:34
and I'm not saying that that is because
17:36
of climate change
17:37
even though
17:43
just this precisely the NFIP is actually
17:48
two for reauthorization this December
17:50
and I would argue that it's time to take
17:52
another shot at serious thoughtful
17:54
reform because we're doubt it we have an
17:56
unstable unsustainable program that is
17:58
indirectly harming some of the people
18:00
that it was designed to help and I don't
18:03
have any type of joke relax I'm not here
18:08
for Tostitos really yeah hold on you can
