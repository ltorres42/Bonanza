George papadopolis the former Trump
00:02
campaign staff and real cool dude
00:05
who it's now admitted to lying to the
00:08
FBI he could be a real problem here
00:11
because we now know not only did
00:14
Papadopoulos have contact with the
00:15
Russians during the campaign who
00:17
apparently told him through an
00:18
intermediary that they had dirt on
00:20
Hillary Clinton but he mentioned his
00:22
Russian contacts to the campaign who
00:25
responded like this a trump campaign
00:28
supervisor told Papadopoulos quote I
00:30
would encourage you to pursue contact
00:33
with Russians and that he had done great
00:35
work you know it speaks to the sheer
00:38
stupidity of the people involved here
00:40
that so many of them often left written
00:43
records of their potentially criminal
00:45
actions it's like if during Watergate we
00:48
had an email chain of Howard hunt saying
00:50
about to break in and Nixon replying
00:53
noise this this would not be stupid
01:01
Watergate without some truly idiotic
01:04
details because one of Papadopoulos is
01:06
former professors described him as
01:07
zealous and a bit simple which
01:10
incidentally is also how you would
01:11
describe a golden retriever in Isis and
01:15
some of his Russian sources turned out
01:17
to be pretty unimpressive Papadopoulos
01:20
was in London meeting with his Russian
01:22
connections including a woman he thought
01:25
was Vladimir Putin's niece but turns out
01:27
was not that's right we are now living
01:31
in an era where at the top New York
01:33
Times headline could conceivably have
01:35
been shades McCool got catfished by a
01:37
fake Putin nice
01:39
Trump is now also desperately trying to
01:42
distance himself in Papadopoulos calling
01:44
him a low-level volunteer which is a
01:45
pretty weak defense because not only did
01:48
Trump once call him an excellent guy
01:50
they were photographed together in a
01:52
national security meeting during the
01:54
campaign that photograph interestingly
01:56
was released earlier this week when the
01:58
seal on grand jury testimony was I'm
02:00
just kidding Trump posted it to his
02:02
Instagram last March
02:04
seedez and while that photo looks pretty
02:06
damning the White House this week
02:08
insisted that it meant nothing they're
02:10
happy you were described Papadopoulos as
02:14
having a limited role when there's a
02:15
there's a photograph of mr. Papadopoulos
02:17
sitting at a table with no she she is
02:25
not actually wrong there Trump has taken
02:27
photos with many many people here's one
02:29
of him with OJ Simpson here's one of
02:32
Trump and Harvey Weinstein he is with
02:35
grimace so think about that the
02:37
president has smoked the photos with
02:40
murderers sexual predators and in the
02:42
case of grimace both but but the point
02:45
is none of them got to sit at the table
02:48
with Trump and his campaign staff and
02:50
when Trump was asked on Friday about
02:52
what had happened in that meeting this
02:53
was his response I don't remember much
02:56
about that meeting it was a very
02:57
unimportant meeting took place all oh
02:59
damn don't remember much about it oh you
03:03
don't remember that that is convenient
03:05
although it's slightly undercut by one
03:07
of trumps favorite boasts people know me
03:10
from my memory it's called like up here
03:13
and it's called memory and it's called
03:15
other things unfortunate that I have a
03:16
good memory I have like a good memory I
03:19
have a very good memory they have a good
03:20
memory like a great memory we'll have a
03:22
great man one of the great memories of
03:24
all time yeah there was just no way to
03:28
reconcile those two positions although
03:31
Trump has actually tried in the past
03:34
because when he was asked during a
03:35
deposition in 2015 about claiming that
03:38
he had one of the world's great memories
03:40
he said and I quote I don't remember
03:42
saying that as good as my memory is I
03:46
don't remember that but I have a good
03:49
memory
03:51
so so right now
